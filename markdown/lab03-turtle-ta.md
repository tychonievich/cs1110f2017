# Logic Groups (15--20 min)

1.  Announce "Get in the logic groups you had last lab"
    -   "You may leave your stuff where it is"
    -   "But bring a pen or pencil and paper"
    -   "If you are new, come see us and we'll match up you."  -- Make a new group of 3 if possible, or add people to some existing groups to make groups of 4.  Also regroup any groups that lost a member to have 3 or 4 per group.
1.  If they are not doing so on their own, say "Part of good group work is being friendly.  Spend a moment and introduce yourself to your group."
1.  Bring up on the screen this: [Bridge crossing](https://docs.google.com/a/virginia.edu/presentation/d/1Cu_mF6NXrFIxl4fUOmNuRax_z0EYZj-j587tUmayjNA/edit?usp=sharing)
1.  Announce "Work with your group to solve this problem"
1.  As they work, have each TA pick 4 groups (or 3 or 5 if not exactly right number) to be their grading groups; ask and record the IDs of these students
    -   ... not to self: decide how we handle these IDs...
1.  Wander the room, but respond to all questions with "I'm not a part of your group. What does your group think?" No matter what they say, nod and move on.
1.  After 5--10 minutes, 
    -   ask "how many of you got 19 seconds?" (wait for hands) "Congratulations! You think like most rational people."
        -   You may ask one to review how it works, or skip if all got it.
        -   I suggest illustrating their narrative
            
            side 1  bridge  side 2  time
            ------- ------- ------  ---------
            ABCDf                   0
            CD              AB  f   +2 = 2
            ACDf            B       +1 = 3
            D               ABC f   +5 = 8
            ADf             BC      +1 = 9
                            ABCDf   +10 = 19

    -   ask "did anyone have an answer smaller than 19 seconds?" and have them share
        -   If they have the fastest person carry the other people, ask "How fast do you think I can run a mile?" "How fast do you think I can run a mile with you on my back?"
        -   If they have the flashlight thrown, ask "how long is the bridge? Do we know they can throw that far?"
        -   If they have one person stand in the middle and everyone else run past, ask "how long is the bridge? Ho far does the light shine?"
        -   If they have a 17-minute solution, have them explain it to the class
            -   "What do we think if this solution?"
            -   "Based on the thunderous applause" (wait for applause if needed) "we like this solution!"
1.  Announce "Return to your seats and let's begin the main lab activity"

> **Important!** Do NOT offer hints, solutions, or clarifying explanations.
> During sharing, don't say "that's a bad solution"---instead ask a question that helps them see it is bad, like those listed above.


# Pairing

Have them pair up however they wish.  If there is an odd number, make one group of 3.

Remind them about pair programming.

-   **2 minds, 1 focus**
-   **Driver and Navigator**
-   **Equality and Communication**
-   **Switch Roles**

You should enforce only one computer open between the pair and announce times to switch roles.

# Normalize struggle

Not all lectures saw the same set of turtle operations.
Some students also played with it more than others.
That's OK.
This is a learn-by-trying exercise, so try and see what you learn.
