# Research Study

Encourage the students to first take the 5-minute survey linked from their lab writeup.  Delay starting logic groups 5 minutes to allow them to do this.  If you get any kind of "do I have to take it" or "do I have to answer question *x*", the answer is always "no, but the researchers would appreciate it if you do."

# Logic Groups

Exam 1 has past; time to form new groups!

-	Have the students (in each grading group if you want them to sit together) form a line
	-	By day and month of birth: "January 1st is over there, December 31st over there"
	-	Without talking: not verbal utterances of any kind!
	- 	Verify the groups (have them share their birthdays out loud) 
	-	Cluster into 3s

The logic problem for today is [a tower problem](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Mnxkc10dHJDfh3J669Eth7lOwvVfX3cQwwV7qfvgBW4/edit?usp=sharing)


# Overview

This is a new kind of lab, since last semester's post-exam-1 lab was not well liked.  Giving a brief overview of the lab would be wise:

1.	You'll write one file with 9 functions in it
	-	It may also contain testing code, or you may put the tests elsewhere
	-	You might not get to all functions; that's OK
	-	You'll submit your file (and maybe a second file if you get to task 10)
1.	We haven't taught you everything you need
	-	But there is a "Tools to Use" section that does
	-	We want you to practice reading and applying on your own
	-	We will help, but we'll ask what you've already tried first...
1.	Read the writeup, then do the tasks

# Spot Check

Each TA should go to

> [The Code Explainer](https://archimedes.cs.virginia.edu/cs1110/explain.php)

and have four of their students explain the produced code sometime during lab.
Have them do this away from other students (i.e., ask them to come to you).
Example questions to ask include

-	Explain to me how your code works.
-	How would your code work differently if we did $Z$ to line $n$?
-	How would you describe the value inside variable $X$ after line $n$? Is that the same as its meaning on line $m$?
-	If I ran it with input/argument $X$, what would it do/return/print?  What value would variable $Y$ have on line $n$?

Answer guidelines:

Clear
:	They seem to both understand their code and understand how to articulate it.

Adequate
:	They seem to basically understand their code, but struggle to explain it.
	Help them out by modeling how you would answer your own questions.

Confused
:	They did not seem to understand their own code.

	Note: if the code doesn't work and they don't know why, that's adequate, not confused;
	confused is when they don't know why/if it will work.

> TAs with 2 labs: sorry, right now Archimedes doesn't know the difference between your two lab groups, so you'll have to skip a lot of students to get to the right ones...

# Helping

One goal is that the students learn some on their own.
Most questions should be answered with questions:

-	What have you already tried?
	-	Did that work?
	-	How do you know it (did/didn't) work?
-	Which tools do you think would work for this?
	-	How could you find out?
	-	Which ones have you tried already?
		-	I'd suggest trying a few...
-	Have you tried working out what it would do yourself using a pencil and paper?
-	Have you tried running it in <http://pythontutor.com>?

Followed by

-	Give that a go and see what happens.

Avoid the temptation to say "yes" or "no" when they ask if something will work.  Instead, "Try it and see."
