# Logic Groups

Exam 1 has past; time to form new groups!

-	Have the students (in each grading group if you want them to sit together) form a line
	-	By day and month of birth: "January 1st is over there, December 31st over there"
	-	Without talking: not verbal utterances of any kind!
	- 	Verify the groups (have them share their birthdays out loud) 
	-	Cluster into 3s

The logic problem for today is [a tower problem](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Mnxkc10dHJDfh3J669Eth7lOwvVfX3cQwwV7qfvgBW4/edit?usp=sharing)


# String Puzzles

This is a new kind of lab, since last semester's post-exam-1 lab was not well liked.  Giving a brief overview of the lab would be wise.
