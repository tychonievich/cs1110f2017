# Logic Groups

Exam 1 has past; time to form new groups!

-	Have the students (in each grading group if you want them to sit together) form a line
	-	By day and month of birth: "January 1st is over there, December 31st over there"
	-	Without talking: not verbal utterances of any kind!
	- 	Verify the groups (have them share their birthdays out loud) 
	-	Cluster into 3s

The logic problem for today is [a tower problem](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Mnxkc10dHJDfh3J669Eth7lOwvVfX3cQwwV7qfvgBW4/edit?usp=sharing)


# Overview

This is a new kind of lab, since last semester's post-exam-1 lab was not well liked.  Giving a brief overview of the lab would be wise:

1.	You'll write one file with 9 functions in it
	-	It may also contain testing code, or you may put the tests elsewhere
	-	You might not get to all functions; that's OK
	-	You'll submit your file (and maybe a second file if you get to task 10)
1.	We haven't taught you everything you need
	-	But there is a "Tools to Use" section that does
	-	We want you to practice reading and applying on your own
	-	We will help, but we'll ask what you've already tried first...
1.	Read the writeup, then do the tasks

# Helping

One goal is that the students learn some on their own.
Most questions should be answered with questions:

-	What have you already tried?
	-	Did that work?
	-	How do you know it (did/didn't) work?
-	Which tools do you think would work for this?
	-	How could you find out?
	-	Which ones have you tried already?
		-	I'd suggest trying a few...
-	Have you tried working out what it would do yourself using a pencil and paper?
-	Have you tried running it in <pythontutor.com>?

Followed by

-	Give that a go and see what happens.

Avoid the temptation to say "yes" or "no" when they ask if something will work.  Instead, "Try it and see."
