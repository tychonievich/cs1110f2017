Let the students rate you.
I'll share their comments about you with you (and only you).

# Quiz Game

1.  Go to the scorer page for your lab section:

2.  Click the "clear the game and prepare for the next lab" link

3.  Have one student per team got to the page for your lab
4.  Show the students your screen (the questions do not show up on the student view, only your view)
5.  Let the teams type answers
