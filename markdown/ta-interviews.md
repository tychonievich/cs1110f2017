title: Interviewing to be a TA
...

# What we want

We have many people apply to be a TA for CS 1110.
We unfortunately lack the funding to hire them all, and also lack the bandwidth to oversee them all if we did hire them all.
Thus, we have to be somewhat selective in whom we hire.

We are looking for TA applicants who

-   Know the material.
    Fall 2017 will teach using the Python language and the PyCharm editor;
    you should be comfortable with these.

-   Did reasonably well in Intro to Programming.
    As and Bs are prefered;
    Cs often represent sufficient struggle that effective TAing is unlikely.
    If you had a C in intro but did better in later courses,
    we encourage you to TA for those later courses.

-   Relate well to struggling students.
    Having struggled yourself can be a plus;
    but in general we want TAs who help calm and validate students
    rather than TAs who show off how much they know or seem condescending.

-   Teach, not solve.
    TA stands for "teaching assistant" not "assignment assistant;"
    we want TAs who help students solve to their own problems.

# Interview

To help evalaute whom to hire, we are instituting a two-phase interview process.
We have not done this before, so there might be some kinks in the systemâ€¦

## Stage 1: TA-led interview

You will sign up for an interview slot with a pair of current CS 1110 TAs.
You'll have 20 minutes; that time will be used as follows:

-   One TA will role-play being a student needing help in an assignment.
    You'll role-play being their TA.
    They'll have some broken code and you'll help them.
    The assignment we'll use is listed below.
    
    The other TA will observe, noting how you do.
    
    This is expected to take 10 minutes.
    
-   You'll be asked to reflect on the role-play.
    What did you do well?  What should you have done differently?

-   There'll be time for you to ask any questions you mgiht want
    about TAing, your performance, etc.

At the end of all TA-led interviews, the TAs will give a list of recommendations to Prof Tychonievich.

TA-led interviews will occur primarily during the last weeks of Spring semester.

## Stage 2: Instructor-led interview

It is our goal to have a TA-let interview for most (if not all) applicants;
Prof Tychonievich, who is just one person, will of necessity have to be more selective.

The basic structure of the instructor-led interview will be similar to the TA-led interview,
though (a) there will be one interviewer present, not two; and (b) the assignment will be different.

We are working to secure promise of funding soon.
However, traditionally the department does not commit to a particular number of TA slots until the first week of classes.
If that tradition holds, instructor-led interviews will occur during the first weeks of classes and hiring decisions will be made at that time.

# The assignments

## Stage 1

Write a program that reads a file containing a list of data in the format:

````
year,month,day,high,low,average
````

It should include a function that calculates the average temperature between two days and takes two lists `[year, month, day]` that represent two days as arguments
and a second method that finds the max temperature in a given month and takes `(year, month)` as arguments.

When run, the program should prompt the user for which function to run and for the data needed to find the corresponding line in the file.

An example data file (obtained from the [national climatic data center](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/)) can be found at <http://cs1110.cs.virginia.edu/files/cho-temp.csv>.
