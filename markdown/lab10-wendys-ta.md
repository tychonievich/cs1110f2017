# Logic Groups and Spot checks

The logic problem for today is not yet determined.  We might do 
[a hard one](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XJFqyRYVFeu7G___GWbBsgjcSEcveT90qCOvlykju5A/edit?usp=sharing),
another [self-referential quiz](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JdjaP9RmBeJtnTvhO_pEZpoqJmtS9rHjp8XVNEggfXA/edit?usp=sharing),
or something else...

Spot checks are on this week (again)

# Exam Reminder

Remind them that we have an exam next week, with [study topics and last semester's exam](review.html) linked from the schedule for the review day.

# Running the Lab

The task we ask is not large, but it involves several new ideas.
Help them remember

-   the open-read-decode sequence (or open-for-decode)
-   to split on commas
-   use the provided distance code (it can be used as-is; not work to do on it)
