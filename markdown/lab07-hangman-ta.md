# Purpose of this lab

This lab has three goals

1.	Motivate the coming introduction to loops, by showing them (a) code that begs a while loop and (b) that life is tedious without loops.
2.	Help them develop a full program with limited scaffolding.
3.	Reinforce the idea of string methods and if statements.

If they finish, their code will be quite long (hundreds of lines) and very repetitive.  This is correct.

# Logic Groups

The logic problem for today is [a jumping problem](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sqzk_tUVI-IXleyGoPhevY-6Ho81H-fVB5E7e8bTK8U/edit?usp=sharing)


# Overview

Remind the students that

1.	They should not use loops
2.	The directions give hints
3.	PyCharm has a find-replace tool (demonstrate it for them) they are likely to find useful

# Spot Check

Because of the exam and reading days, there were no assignments due since last lab, so no spot-check this week.  It will resume next week.


# Example solution

I don't usually do this, but this code is so strange-looking I suspect many TAs will think the correct code looks wrong:
