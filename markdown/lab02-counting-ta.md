# Logic Groups (20 min)

1.  Announce "Form a line, alphabetically, by compuring ID; aa2a over there, zzz9zz over there"
    -   "You may leave your stuff where it is"
    -   "But bring a pen or pencil and paper"
1.  Walk down the line, clustering people in 3s. If there are not enough, form 1 or 2 groups of 4
1.  Announce "This is your logic group for the next several weeks.  We'll begin each lab with a logic group activity"
1.  Announce "Find a place to sit with your group.  It doesn't need to be with your stuff, you'll return to that soon."
1.  If they are not doing so on their own, say "Part of good group work is being friendly.  Spend a moment and introduce yourself to your group."
1.  Bring up on the screen this: [Pigs in a Pen](https://docs.google.com/a/virginia.edu/presentation/d/1GOC80OL6ewAyWKCUaPESuPmiBF1rzLiUJ77D9SnTqkg/edit?usp=sharing)
1.  Announce "Work with your group to solve this problem"
1.  Wander the room, but respond to all questions with "I'm not a part of your group. What does your group think?" No matter what they say, nod and move on.
    -   This would be a good time to take attendance.
1.  After 5--10 minutes, ask "Who would like to share your solution?"
    -   Invite one to the board to draw and explain it to the class
    -   "What do we think if this solution?"
    -   "Based on the thunderous applause" (wait for applause if needed) "we like this solution!  Does anyone have a different solution they'd like to share?"
    -   Repeat until you tire of it or until all distinct solutions have been shared.
1.  Announce "We'll use these same groups to start out with next week, so remember who they are."
1.  Announce "Return to your seats and let's begin the main lab activity"

> **Important!** Do NOT offer hints, solutions, or clarifying explanations.  Don't say "that's a bad solution"---instead ask a question that helps them see it is bad, like "I see you have one pig half in one pen and half in another. Can yo uexplain more about this pig?"


# Pairing

Have them pair up however they wish.  If there is an odd number, make one group of 3.

Overview pair programming.

-   **2 minds, 1 focus**
-   **Driver and Navigator**
-   **Equality and Communication**
-   **Switch Roles**

You should enforce only one computer open between the pair and announce times to switch roles.

# Grid of Doors

Explain this is a pseudo-code and problem solving exercise.
Also that reading instructions is important; they should first read the assignment in full together with their partner, ask any clarifying questions, then return to the top and work through it in order.

Announce that we grade labs primarily on participation;
it is more important that they have a good solution to the first step than that the solve all four steps.
