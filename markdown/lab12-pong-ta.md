# Logic Groups and Spot checks

The logic puzzle today is about [a race](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PsrfYMtr36POju_uTe0MuL6XLQ0jo6xoQx5a0Mo65DA/edit?usp=sharing)

Spot checks are on this week (again)



# Project partners

View the set of registered partners for your lab section at
<https://archimedes.cs.virginia.edu/cs1110/partners.php>.
Help match up those who are not yet matched.

If someone wishes to work alone (and you agree; more grading work that way...), enter their ID twice, separated with commas.

If you have an odd number of unmatched people (and only if you do),
you can grant permission for one group of 3; enter three IDs separated by commas to form the group.


## Finish `pong.py`

There are many comments in `pong.py` that should help them make progress on this assignment.
