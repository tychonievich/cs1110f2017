# Logic Groups and Spot checks

The logic puzzle today is about [crossing a river](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tkhrWDVq6Uvm8gYKAnP2b3PoV2Vmo7efdBM1641e4zk/edit?usp=sharing)

Spot checks are on this week (again): <https://archimedes.cs.virginia.edu/cs1110/explain.php>



# Project partners

Hopefully everyone is partnered by now, but if not the partnering site is still open.  We'll close it (prevent future edits) soon.

## Finding emails

This lab should more-or-less run itself.
Feel free to encourage groups to work with other groups if they are getting stuck.
