# Rate your TAs

The CS 111x TAs work hard to make this course run as well as it does.
Since UVA's course feedback system does not have an obvious place to rate TAs, they often don't get a lot of feedback.
Please take a moment to fill out the feedback for your lab's TAs:

[TA Feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5eu8aMxCFOfthzOjvhlN02JTVdga26KHC0LgBLMrzvuDGxA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Want to give feedback for other TAs (not in your lab) too?  Feel free!

# Course Evals

There are also evals for this and every other course you are enrolled in in Collab.
As a general rule we only read the evals for lecture sections, so there is no obvious reason to submit evals for lab sections;
but we do read and value your lecture section feedback!

# Review Activity

## Quiz Game

Form up teams for the CS 1110 review quiz game!
Our quiz game tool is simple (so much so you have to use the right link for your room),
but it will let us review with a (hopefully) fun element of competition.

One (1) member of each team should go to the proper link for your lab room:

> [Olsson 001](https://stardock.cs.virginia.edu/quiz/)
>         
> [Mec 213, Olsson 009](https://stardock.cs.virginia.edu/mecquiz/)
>
> [Rice 120, Thorton A120](https://stardock.cs.virginia.edu/ricequiz/)

## TA-led review

With remaining time, the TAs will lead a review of [other course material](know.html#exam-3).
