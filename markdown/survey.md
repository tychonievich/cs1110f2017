# Lighthouse EC Survey

You are invited to participate in a survey for Lighthouse EC, a research study funded by the National Science Foundation (grant #1712443) about the efficacy of diversity-focused collaborative learning activities in computing courses to establish instructional principles to retain more diverse students in computing. This study is conducted by Dr. James Cohoon, Dr. Yunjeong Chang, Dr. Leslie Cintron, and Dr. Luther Tychonievich from the University of Virginia.

**Purpose of the research study:** The goal of Lighthouse EC is to improve the number and gender balance of students in undergraduate computer science courses by enhancing collaborative learning activities in the classroom, so that computing disciplines and occupations eventually become more diverse.

Your decision to participate or decline participation in this study is completely voluntary and you have the right to terminate your participation at any time without penalty. You may skip any questions you do not wish to answer. If you want do not wish to complete the survey, do not click the survey button, but we wish you would do so as your opinion is valuable to this study.

Your participation in this research will be completely confidential. Possible outlets of dissemination may be journal articles or presentations, but all data will be in aggregate and anonymous.  Although your participation in this research may not benefit you personally, it will help us understand the optimum design for computing courses to increase diversity, and hopefully will increase the number of women and underrepresented minorities into computing courses.

**Time required:** The survey will require about 5-7 minutes of your time.

**Risks:** There are no risks to individuals participating in this survey beyond those that exist in daily life.

**Benefits:** While you will not benefit directly from this research, the findings from this research may benefit future students and teachers retaining more diverse students (women and members of underrepresented minority groups) in computing courses.

**How to withdraw from the study:** If you want to withdraw from the study, tell the researchers.  There is no penalty for withdrawing.

**Payment:** You will receive no payment for participating in the study.
